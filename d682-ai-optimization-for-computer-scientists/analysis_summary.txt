# D3 – Analysis of Evaluation Metrics

This project achieved **RMSE 0.196** and **R² 0.931** on the hold‑out test set.

Key points (see Section D3 in Narrative_Report.docx for full discussion):
1. RMSE below 0.2 shows very low average prediction error.
2. R² of 0.93 indicates 93% of variance in healthRiskScore is explained.
3. Cross‑validation RMSE closely matches hold‑out RMSE, suggesting minimal overfitting.
4. Primary residual spikes occur on high‑humidity days, implying a need for true pollution inputs (outlined in D4 improvement plan).
