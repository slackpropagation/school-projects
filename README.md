# Repository Overview

This repository contains my project work and practice focused on Software Quality Assurance (SQA) and Testing methodologies.  
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my ability to design, document, and execute software testing processes that ensure application quality, reliability, and maintainability. Through these projects, I practiced writing formal test plans, developing manual and automated test cases, applying different testing strategies, and identifying and documenting software defects. It reflects my understanding of how quality control fits into the overall software development lifecycle and my ability to create processes that help catch issues early and maintain product integrity.

The repository showcases my work across various aspects of quality assurance, including functional testing, boundary testing, negative testing, usability testing, and system integration testing. It also covers creating detailed test documentation, tracking defects, and reporting on testing outcomes in a professional format. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of version control in managing test scripts, results, and continuous quality improvements.
