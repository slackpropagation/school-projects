This repository contains my hands-on practice and project work in version control using Git and GitLab.  
It is focused on demonstrating foundational version control skills essential for professional software development, including branch management, conflict resolution, tagging, project history analysis, and documentation.  
Through these projects and exercises, I strengthened my ability to use Git effectively both through the command line and GitLab’s web interface, preparing for real-world development workflows.
=======
This repository contains my hands-on project work with Spring Boot, Java, MySQL, and Git version control, developed to build and manage backend services following modern best practices.  
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my ability to create fully functional RESTful web applications, integrate Java-based services with relational databases, and maintain clean, version-controlled codebases. Through this project, I practiced structuring Spring Boot applications with appropriate layering, managing entity relationships, implementing data validation, handling errors gracefully, and collaborating effectively using Git and GitLab/GitHub workflows. It reflects both my backend development skills and my experience with real-world software development processes.

=======
This repository contains my dedicated work on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and practices, showcasing a variety of projects and assignments completed using C++.  
The purpose of this repository is to build a strong foundation in OOP principles, emphasizing how they contribute to creating organized, modular, and maintainable codebases.  
Through these exercises, I focused on mastering the core pillars of OOP—such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction—and explored practical applications like file handling, operator overloading, and memory management via constructors and destructors.  
This experience helped me deepen my understanding of how real-world software models complex systems and interactions through objects and classes, a fundamental skill for professional software development.
