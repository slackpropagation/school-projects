# Repository Overview

This repository consolidates my school projects across multiple Computer Science courses; it includes hands-on work with Git and GitLab for version control; backend development using Spring Boot and Java; Object-Oriented Programming exercises in C++; end-to-end AI/ML assignments from data exploration to model deployment; Docker-based containerization and deployment workflows; Software Quality Assurance test plans and automated/manual test cases; and Data Structures & Algorithms implementations and analyses. Each folder demonstrates practical skills, clean code practices, and real-world development processes that build a solid foundation in software engineering.
