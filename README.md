# Repository Overview

This repository contains my hands-on project work with Spring Boot, Java, MySQL, and Git version control, developed to build and manage backend services following modern best practices.  
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my ability to create fully functional RESTful web applications, integrate Java-based services with relational databases, and maintain clean, version-controlled codebases. Through this project, I practiced structuring Spring Boot applications with appropriate layering, managing entity relationships, implementing data validation, handling errors gracefully, and collaborating effectively using Git and GitLab/GitHub workflows. It reflects both my backend development skills and my experience with real-world software development processes.
