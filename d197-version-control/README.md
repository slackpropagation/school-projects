# Version Control with Git

This repository contains my completed project for the **Version Control** course.

The purpose of this project is to build foundational version control skills using Git and GitLab. Through hands-on tasks, students learn how to manage code changes across different branches, resolve merge conflicts, and maintain a detailed history of a project's evolution. Mastering these skills is critical for real-world software development, where collaborative coding, conflict resolution, and accurate version tracking are essential for maintaining stable and efficient workflows. Completing this project helps students understand how professional teams coordinate their work, ensuring consistent, traceable, and conflict-free updates to shared codebases. It also reinforces key concepts like semantic versioning, effective documentation, and using command-line tools in software engineering environments.

## Project Summary

- Demonstrated core Git skills, including branch creation, commit management, and conflict resolution
- Created and managed multiple branches (`main`, `Test`, `Working`) to simulate team collaboration
- Intentionally created merge conflicts and successfully resolved them using Git commands
- Used semantic versioning to tag releases (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- Documented all activities with complete Git logs and a detailed retrospective summary
- Compiled final project documentation with screenshots and commentary on the workflow process

## Key Components

- **Branch Management**: Created and switched between multiple branches (`main`, `Test`, `Working`)
- **Merge Conflict Handling**: Generated conflicts on purpose and resolved them using CLI
- **Version Tagging**: Applied semantic versioning practices to tag stable versions of the project
- **Retrospective Documentation**:
  - `log.txt`: Full output of the Git commit log
  - `summary.txt`: Overview of the merge conflict process and task descriptions
  - Final screenshots and narrative explaining the version control workflow

## Algorithms and Commands Used

- `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`
- `git checkout -b [branch-name]`
- `git merge [branch-name]`
- Conflict resolution using Nano editor
- `git tag [version]`
- `git log > log.txt`
- `echo "[summary]" > summary.txt`

## Task Requirements Covered

- Initialized a local Git repository and linked it to a remote GitLab repository
- Created multiple branches and switched between them effectively
- Simulated and resolved merge conflicts
- Tagged versions according to semantic versioning standards
- Produced a comprehensive retrospective directory with Git logs and project summaries
- Documented all major steps with screenshots and explanations

## What I Learned

- Hands-on experience with real-world Git workflows including branching, merging, and version tagging
- How to identify and resolve merge conflicts efficiently through the command line
- Best practices for documenting project histories and workflows
- Importance of maintaining a clean and traceable Git history for team collaboration
- Developed confidence using Git and GitLab for professional software development tasks
