# Class Roster

This repository contains my completed project for the C867 Scripting and Programming â€“ Applications course at Western Governors University (WGU).
In this project, I built a student roster management system in C++, focusing on applying foundational object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to solve a practical problem. The program simulates a backend system for managing student records, teaching students how to design and implement classes, inheritance structures, dynamic arrays, and basic data validation workflows. Through completing this project, students develop strong skills in object-oriented design, memory management using constructors and destructors, modular programming by separating code across multiple files, and real-world debugging practices. It also reinforces core software development principles like separation of concerns, data parsing, and version control using Git.

## Project Summary

The goal of this project was to apply object-oriented programming principles in C++ to create a student roster system. The program demonstrates the use of classes, inheritance, arrays, and other core OOP concepts.

## Key Components

- `student.h/.cpp`: Class definitions for student objects
- `degree.h`: Enum for degree programs (SECURITY, NETWORK, SOFTWARE)
- `roster.h/.cpp`: Core logic to manage a dynamic array of student objects
- `main.cpp`: Driver program to load data, process the roster, and call required functions

### Functionality

- Parsing and storing student data
- Printing all students
- Printing invalid emails
- Calculating average days in course
- Filtering by degree program
- Removing a student by ID

## Tools Used

- C++ (GCC / Clang)
- Visual Studio Code / CLion
- Git & GitHub for version control
- macOS Terminal or Linux Bash

## What I Learned

- Designing and implementing classes in C++
- Using arrays and pointers effectively
- Managing object lifecycles and memory (constructors/destructors)
- Modular programming across multiple source files
- Applying basic software development principles like separation of concerns and version control
