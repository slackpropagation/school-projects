# Predicting Customer Churn with Machine Learning for Telecom

## Project Overview

Customer churn significantly impacts telecom profitability, with typical churn rates between 15% and 25% annually. This project implements a proactive machine learning-powered churn prediction system that identifies high-risk customers using real-time analytics, enabling strategic interventions to enhance retention.

## Business Problem

Traditional churn management strategies are reactive, relying on indicators such as late payments or service downgrades that surface too late. With high acquisition costs (5-7 times greater than retention), reducing churn is crucial to profitability and market stability.

## Solution Summary

Our solution employs supervised machine learning algorithms—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)—to analyze structured customer data, including:
- Demographics
- Billing history
- Service usage patterns
- Customer support interactions
- Account tenure

The system generates real-time churn probability scores, delivering actionable insights via a secure REST API integrated into CRM dashboards.

## Project Goals

- **Reduce churn rate by 15% within 12 months**
- **Increase proactive retention success rate by 20%**

## Key Features

- **Automated Data Processing Pipeline**: Cleans, normalizes, and prepares data for modeling.
- **Advanced Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression for interpretability, Random Forest for accuracy, and SVM for complex pattern recognition.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: RESTful API provides immediate churn scores.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Allows retention, marketing, and support teams to prioritize actions.

## Technical Stack

- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, scikit-learn, FastAPI, pandas, NumPy
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS EC2, S3, RDS
